# advanced-java
This repository focuses on advanced Java topics module of the T-Academy bootcamp by ProWay and T-Systems., including collections, lambda expressions, functional programming, and exception handling. It's designed for developers looking to enhance their skills and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Module Content
### 1. Collections
- **Frameworks and Classes:** Architecture to store and manipulate groups of objects.

### 2. Lambda Functions
- **Lambda Functions:** Anonymous functions that provide a clear and concise way to represent single-method interfaces using an expression.

### 3. Annotations
- **Annotations:** Metadata that provides information about a program but is not part of the program itself. Used to provide information to the compiler and to be processed at runtime.

### 4. Generics
- **Generics:** Allows a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.

### 5. Working with Dates
- **Date and Time Classes:** `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `DateTimeFormatter` in the `java.time` package.

### 6. Exceptions and Error Handling
- **Exception Handling:** Mechanisms to handle runtime errors, ensuring that the program can continue or terminate gracefully.

### 7. Functional Programming and Lambda Expressions
- **Functional Programming:** A paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding state changes and mutable data.

### 8. Threads
- **Parallel Programming:** Running multiple threads simultaneously to perform tasks concurrently, improving performance and efficiency.
- **Concurrent Programming:** Managing multiple threads, ensuring they operate correctly and efficiently in a shared environment.
